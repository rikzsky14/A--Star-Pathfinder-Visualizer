This python program that utilizes the A* Search Algorithm to visualize the fastest path from location 1 to location 2 with optional barriers dictated by the user. Copy the code into your favored IDE or run the code by itself. First click on the graphic establishes location 1, Second click on the graphic establishes location 2, and the barriers can be created by clicking each square or dragging the cursor around the screen while holding the click button. REMEMBER TO PRESS THE SPACEBAR TO START THE VISUALIZATION. If it is impossible for location 1 to reach location 2, there will be no purple path (purple path indicates the quickest path).
